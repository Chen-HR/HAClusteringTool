class VirtualPoint:
  """
  The `VirtualPoint` class represents weighted virtual points between two given points.

  ### Attributes:
  - `point`: Tuple representing the position of the virtual point (midpoint between two input points).
  - `weight`: Weight of the virtual point calculated using the formula log(1/(𝑑/𝑟)), where 𝑑 is the distance between two points and 𝑟 is the distance limitation coefficient.

  ### Methods:
  - `__init__(self, point1: tuple, point2: tuple, limit: float)`: Initializes a VirtualPoint instance.
    - `point1`: Tuple representing the coordinates of the first point.
    - `point2`: Tuple representing the coordinates of the second point.
    - `limit`: Distance limitation coefficient (𝑟).

  ### Example Usage:
  ```python
  # Example Usage
  point1 = (0, 0)
  point2 = (1, 1)
  limit = 2.0
  virtual_point = VirtualPoint(point1, point2, limit)
  print(virtual_point.point)   # Output: (0.5, 0.5)
  print(virtual_point.weight)  # Output: 0.707107
  ```

  ### Explanation:
  - The `point` attribute is the midpoint between `point1` and `point2`.
  - The `weight` attribute is calculated using the formula log(1/(𝑑/𝑟)), where 𝑑 is the distance between `point1` and `point2`.
  - The `__init__` method initializes the virtual point based on the provided points and distance limitation coefficient.
